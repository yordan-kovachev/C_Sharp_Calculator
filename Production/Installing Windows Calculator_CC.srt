00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:04,666
Installing Windows Calculator

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:10,666
This is a custom made installation setup for the app built inside Visual Studio with InstallShield.

3
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:18,366
Developed in C# programming language.

4
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:25,166
Designed using Windows Forms for the user interface.

5
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:32,266
In action performing standard calculations. Some of the functions 
include:

6
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:42,832
- Delete last entry and perform different calculation;

7
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:52,933
- Users can change the mathematical operator at any time;

8
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:59,366
- Some of the processes happening behind the scenes are: User Input Validation, Error Handling for smooth application performance.

9
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:05,599
- It filters garbage data and produces error free outputs to the user - for example if an operator is pressed more than once.

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:14,000
- It works with negative values and percentages.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,466
User Accessibility and Usability is implemented via keyboard navigation, Mnemonics, Hot Keys, Tool Tips and change of System Colour Scheme.

12
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:27,699
For example visually impaired people can use screen reader software to navigate around with the TAB button.

13
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,533
Pressing ALT on your keyboard activates Mnemonics that underlines frequentlly used buttons and menus.

14
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:37,666
In this case last entry is deleted by pressing 'D' button and with 'C' you can clear all of the entries.

15
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:41,866
Like so users can access the menu by pressing 'M'

16
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:45,466
and by selecting the hot key 'Ctrl + C' you can exit the app.

17
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:50,432
Yet other helpful feature is the High Contrast function that 
performs validation over the Windows OS system colour scheme.

18
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:55,266
In this mode other users can still access all of the functions within the app.

19
00:01:55,266 --> 00:02:04,232
Tool Tips are very good way to tell and inform users how to use 
the application and make their choice.

20
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:07,999
Thank you for watching.
